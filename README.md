# Pointless Adventures - Project 1

UCLA Bootcamp Project 1- Tima and Jerry Carmona

This was the first project for the full stack web development program at UCLA, in which the goal was to build an interactive application that:

-Must use at least two server-side APIs -Must use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap -Must be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input) -Use at least one new third-party API -Must have a polished UI -Must meet good quality coding standards -Does not use alerts, confirms or prompts (look into modals) -Must be deployed to GitHub Pages

# Technologies

For this project, we used three server-side API's targeted for getting data about flights, weather and points of interest: RapidAPI, GoogleAPI and openweather API See links below:

- rapid API- https://tripadvisor1.p.rapidapi.com/

- google AP- https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place

- opeanweather API- https://api.openweathermap.org/

For styling, we used the CSS framework, materalize. See link below:

For scripting, we also used JQuery:

Moments used for date calculations:

# Purpose 

The intention in building this applciaiton was to provide information on a travel destination including flights, weather and points of interest. We built the applciaiton in hopes of preventing packing mishaps before trips and to make sure no time goes to waste in newly trveled destinations by providing ideas on fun things to do. 

# How to use

User enters airports and dates for arrival and departure of their trip, the applciaiton will then provide list of flights ranked by cheapest and provide details on wether flight has stops. User can then look at the weatehr and activities to do in their travel destination. User currently has to enter search for weather and activities on a map but in future versions we hope to have all information populated when first search is made.
